# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Experiments

## Modeling and Evaluation

##### Colin Simon - 4/24/2020


## Document Summary
In this project, we will gather data from two different reddit.com subforums('subreddits'). Then, we'll attempt to create a model that can classify which subreddit any given post came from.

    - We will focus more on the effectiveness and analysis of the models in general than the utility of the predictor itself
